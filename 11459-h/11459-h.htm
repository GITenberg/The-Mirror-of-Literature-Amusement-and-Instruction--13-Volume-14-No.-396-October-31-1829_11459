    <p>
      This Engraving, to use a cant phrase, is an exquisite "bit of
      Blarney;" but independent of the vulgar association, it has a
      multitude of attractions for every reader. Its interest will,
      however, be materially enhanced by the following admirable
      description from the graphic pen of T. Crofton Croker,
      Esq.<a id="footnotetag1"
      name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Blarney, so famous in Irish song and story, is situated about
      four miles north west of Cork, and was, within these few
      years, a thriving manufacturing village; but it no longer
      wears the aspect of comfort or of business, and appears much
      gone to decay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alteration struck me very forcibly. In 1815, I remember a
      large square of neat cottages, and the area, a green shaded
      by fine old trees. Most of the cottages are now roofless; the
      trees have been cut down, and on my last visit, in 1821, a
      crop of barley was ripening in the square.
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="i4">
          "the clam'rous rooks
        </p>
        <p>
          Ask for their wonted seat, but ask in vain!
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          Their ancient home is level'd with the earth,
        </p>
        <p>
          Never to wave again its leafy head,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          Or yield a covert to the feather'd choir,
        </p>
        <p>
          Who now, with broken song, remote and shy,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          Seek other bowers, their native branches gone!"
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      This prepared me to expect a similar change in the grounds of
      the castle, where much timber has been also felled; but the
      grounds still are beautiful, rock and water being features in
      the landscape, the picturesque effect of which neglect cannot
      injure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The castle consists of a massive square tower, that rises
      broad and boldly above surrounding trees, on a precipitous
      rock over a stream called the Awmartin; and attached to the
      east side is an extensive dwelling-house, erected about a
      century since by Sir James Jeffreys, who purchased or
      obtained this estate from the crown, and in whose family it
      still continues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blarney Castle was built about the middle of the fifteenth
      century, by Cormac MacCarty, or Carthy surnamed Laider, or
      the Strong. He was descended from the kings of Cork, and was
      esteemed so powerful a chieftain that the English settlers in
      his part of Munster paid him an annual tribute of forty
      pounds to protect them from the attacks and <i>insults</i>
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page274" name="page274"></a>[pg
      274]</span> of the Irish. To him is also ascribed the
      building of the Abbey and Castle of Kilcrea, the Nunnery of
      Ballyvacadine, and many other religious houses; in the former
      of which he was buried.<a id="footnotetag2"
      name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
      It would be a matter of little importance and considerable
      labour to trace the Castle of Blarney from one possessor to
      another. The genealogical table in Keating's "History of
      Ireland" will enable those addicted to research to follow the
      Mac Carty pedigree; but a tiresome repetition of names,
      occasioned by the scantiness of them in an exceedingly
      numerous family, present continual causes of perplexity to
      the general reader. The names of Donough, Cormac, Teague,
      Florence, Dermot, Owen, and Donnel, constitute almost the
      whole catalogue used by the Mac Carties<a id="footnotetag3"
      name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>
      for a period exceeding six hundred years.<a id="footnotetag4"
      name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>
      This difficulty is heightened from the entire Sept being, in
      point of fact, without a sirname, as the followers of most
      chieftains in Ireland as well as Scotland assumed that of
      their lord. In the reign of Edward IV. a statute was enacted,
      commanding each individual to take upon himself a separate
      sirname, "either of his trade and faculty, or of some quality
      of his body or mind, or of the place where he dwelt, so that
      every one should be distinguished from the other." But this
      statute did not effect the object proposed, and Spenser, in
      his "View of Ireland," mentions it as having become obsolete,
      and strongly recommends its renewal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The military and historic recollections connected with
      Blarney are doubtless of sufficient importance to give an
      interest to the place; but to a curious superstition it is
      perhaps more indebted for celebrity. A stone in the highest
      part of the castle wall is pointed out to visitors, which is
      supposed to give to whoever kisses it the peculiar privilege
      of deviating from veracity with unblushing countenance
      whenever it may be convenient&mdash;hence the well-known
      phrase of "<i>Blarney</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      The grounds attached to the castle, as I before observed,
      though so little attended to, are still beautiful. Walks,
      which a few years since were neat and trim, are now so
      overrun with brambles and wild flowers as to be passed with
      difficulty. Much wood has also been cut down, and the
      statues, so ridiculously enumerated in a popular song,
      removed. A picturesque bridge too, which led to the castle,
      has been swept away by the wintry floods, and, with the
      exception of a small dell called the Rock Close, every thing
      seems changed for the worse. In this romantic spot nature and
      art (a combination rather uncommon in pleasure-grounds) have
      gone hand in hand. Advantage has been taken of accidental
      circumstances to form tasteful and characteristic
      combinations; and it is really a matter of difficulty at
      first to determine what is primitive, and what the produce of
      design. The delusion is even heightened by the present total
      neglect. You come most unexpectedly into this little shaded
      nook, and stand upon a natural terrace above the river, which
      glides as calmly as possible beneath. Here, if you feel
      inclined for contemplation, a rustic couch of rock, all
      festooned with moss and ivy, is at your service; but if
      adventurous feelings urge you to explore farther, a discovery
      is made of an almost concealed, irregularly excavated passage
      through the solid rock, which is descended by a rude flight
      of stone steps, called the "Witches Stairs," and you emerge
      <i>sul margine d'un rio</i>, over which depend some light and
      graceful trees. It is indeed a fairy scene, and I know of no
      place where I could sooner imagine these little elves holding
      their moonlight revelry.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short distance to the south-west of the castle is a lake,
      said to abound with a species of leech. It does not afford
      one good subject for the pencil, being without islands, the
      margin swampy, and the adjacent trees planted with too much
      attention to regularity. It is a very generally believed
      tradition that, before Blarney surrendered to King William's
      forces, Lord Clancarty's plate was made up in an 'oaken
      chest, which was thrown into this lake, and has not since
      been recovered; nor does
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name="page275"></a>[pg
      275]</span> this appear improbable, as I understand repeated
      attempts have in vain been made to drain it. In 1814, the
      late Mr. Milliken, whose well-known song of "the Groves of
      Blarney" has identified his memory with the place, gave me a
      clumsy silver ring for the finger, which had been taken out
      of the lake by a boy who was fishing in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I am on the subject of discoveries, it may be worth
      notice that, in a quarry close to the castle, where some men
      were working, we picked up several human bones, and that one
      of the labourers informed us so many as twenty horse loads of
      these bones had been thrown into the lake; he also spoke of
      two or three spear-heads being found with them. Groats and
      pennies of the Edwards and Henries have frequently been dug
      up here; but I believe never in any quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior of the castle contains little worth notice
      except a full-length portrait of Charles XII. of Sweden, said
      to be an original, and brought here by one of the Jeffreys'
      family who was envoy to that monarch.

        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Glancing back to the commencement of the nineteenth century,
      the only <i>annual</i> record of poetry and prose which we
      recollect, was "The Flowers of Literature;" a thick
      duodecimo, habited in a flesh-coloured wrapper, and retaining
      in its print and pages, the quaintness which characterized
      "the good old days" of the "Universal Magazine;" and which
      still clings, though somewhat modified, to the patriarchal
      pages of Sylvanus Urban. The matter was in accordance with
      the manner&mdash;a medley of prosing articles, from the
      titles of which we might select, as indicative of their
      style, "Ode to Despair;" "Topographical Description of
      Paris;" "The Sailor;" more agreeably interspersed with some
      effusion of Mrs. Barbauld, or Mrs. Opie; mingled, again, with
      sundry "Observations on the Present State of the War,"
      written by some sleepy newspaper editor, whose language we
      might assimilate with, "We have received intelligence from,"
      &amp;c. Here and there, perhaps, a straggling beam of genius
      broke through the mental twilight, in the shape of, "Some
      Account of the poet, Burns;" a <i>Rustique</i> by Bloomfield,
      or an elegant sonnet by Bowles or Charlotte Smith. The rest
      of would-be-sonneteers, tragedy-writers, and essayists, have
      long ago found, with their mediocrities, a congenial oblivion
      in "the tomb of all the Capulets."
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly, and without much premise to warrant the
      commencement of such an era, the department of our
      imaginative literature was established in patronage and
      importance; and those "trivial, fond records," which were
      wont only to sparkle a brief endurance in the mutable columns
      of a newspaper, or doomed, when existing in fragile
      manuscript, "to die and be forgot," found a refuge from their
      Lethean fate in the numerous Magazines which the increased
      taste, and avidity for reading, evinced by the public, had
      called into existence. Still there was a <i>desideratum</i>,
      which these adornments of English Literature, "The Annuals,"
      alone supplied. The casual tones which emanated from the
      "transcendent masters of the lyre," were not to be lost to
      "the public ear" for want of "a circulating medium;" and
      Ackermann, a name familiar to the lovers of pictorial art,
      had the honour of first setting England the example of
      preserving her valuable anthology, by producing his
      attractive Annual, "The Forget-Me-Not;" a species of
      literature which presents us with the pleasing facility of
      holding yearly communion with our poets and authors, without
      being subjected to the tedium of awaiting their protracted
      appearance in a more voluminous shape. We can now more
      frequently greet Anacreon Moore, wreathing his harp with the
      paternal shamrock, characteristically mingled with "pansies
      <i>for love</i>;" Montgomery, mourning over our nature's
      degradation; telling us of the affections and passions of
      earth, yet luring us to higher hopes and brighter
      consummation; his every line evincing that chastened sorrow
      which Byron threw into the portrait of the Sheffield
      bard&mdash;

      Yet, however splendid the galaxy of literary stars may be,
      which illumine our Annuals, they owe no little of their
      lustre to <i>the engravings</i>. It fortuitously happens that
      we have not "a connoisseuring eye," or we should swell this
      paper beyond the limits prescribed by editorial complaisance,
      in the pages of "THE MIRROR." We are not ignorant, however,
      of the incomparable advancement which the science of
      engraving has made in the lapse of the last ten years; or how
      far it has left behind those mere scratches of the graver
      which lit up our young admiration when a boy. Two of these we
      will be impertinent enough to criticise, in spite of the
      affection with which we cherish the visionary recollection of
      the pictures of grandmother's parlour. The subjects were
      "courtship," and "matrimony." In the former, the
      Chesterfieldian lover was seen handing his <i>chere amie</i>
      (a lusty wench, with red ochre cheeks) over a remarkably low
      stile: whether the subject, or the manner of its execution
      had inspired the muse, is no matter; but beneath was the
      following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          "In <i>courtship</i>, Strephon careful hands his lass
        </p>
        <p>
          Over a stile a child with ease might pass"
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      The next was "matrimony;" but, oh! "look on <i>this</i>
      picture and on <i>this!</i>" The careless husband, forgetting
      his capacious spouse, leaves her to scramble over a stile of
      alarming altitude, whilst his attention seems absorbed in the
      quarrel of two snarling terriers. Such conjugal uncourtliness
      elicits its merited censure in the cool satire of the
      accompanying motto:&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          "But <i>wedded</i> Strephon now neglects his dame:
        </p>
        <p>
          Tumble or not, to him 'tis all the same."
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      The costume of these two figures was in accordance with the
      date of the hey-day of Ranelagh Gardens; and the outline of
      the foliage was about on a par with those designs we often
      see cut out of paper, by an ingenious schoolboy yet they may
      be adduced as criterions of the average merit appertaining to
      the generality of the productions of the burine of "the old
      school."

    <p>
      In closing this erratic dissertation on the Annuals, we may
      remark, that an interesting article might be written,
      descriptive of the reformation which gradually elevated the
      art of engraving to perfection&mdash;a history of its
      emerging from the inanities which flaunt in the window of
      Carver and Bowles, in St. Paul's Churchyard, and arriving at
      the exquisite perfection of such achievements as "Alexander's
      Visit to Diogenes," and "Quintus Curtius leaping into the
      Gulf."

      FINE ARTS.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      SCHOOL OF PAINTING AT THE BRITISH INSTITUTION, PALL MALL.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>To the Editor of the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir,&mdash;I have recently had the pleasure of visiting the
      British Institution, and hope the following remarks on a few
      of the best works will prove acceptable to those of your
      readers who are interested in the Fine Arts.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is customary at this Institution to open, every autumn, a
      school for the study of painting, in which students have an
      opportunity of copying the best productions of the greatest
      masters. The present school opened a few weeks ago, and
      furnishes some exquisite specimens of art, which were
      selected by the directors as examples for imitation. In
      general the students have been very enterprising this season,
      and their copies, if not quite equal in every respect to the
      charming originals, are nevertheless very meritorious and
      masterly attempts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Holy Family</i>, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, is a
      remarkably fine specimen of colour, and has been successfully
      copied by Messrs. Boaden, Fisk, Child, and Inskipp. Small
      copies, in water colours, have also been done from it by Miss
      Sharpe, and Miss Fanny Corbaux. Much praise is due to Mr.
      Morton, for his whole length <i>Portrait of a Gentleman</i>,
      after Vandyke; and Messrs. Simpson, Higham, and Middleton,
      deserve high commendation for executing the best <i>fac
      similia</i> of Rembrandt's <i>Portrait of a Lady</i>. The
      <i>Landscape with Boors</i>, is a delightful little picture
      by Teniers, belonging to his Majesty: numerous attempts have
      been made to imitate it, but not altogether with success. Mr.
      Hart's copy, however, is extremely
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page278" name="page278"></a>[pg
      278]</span> clever. Poussin's <i>Landscape and Figures</i>,
      has engaged the pencil of Mr. Burbank, who has produced a
      most elaborate copy in water colours. Mr. Foster displays
      considerable ability in his <i>Hobbima;</i> and Messrs. Lee,
      Earl, Watts, and Dujardin, have equally excelled in their
      copies from the cattle piece by Cuyp. In De Hooge's picture,
      the <i>Exterior with Figures</i>, we are delighted with the
      representation of a fine summer evening: a peculiar warmth is
      diffused over every object, and the lengthened shadows
      indicate sunset: of this work, Mr. Novice has executed the
      best finished copy; Miss Dujardin's, however, is exceedingly
      good, and contains much promise. Another splendid example of
      art is a <i>Large Landscape</i>, by Gainsborough, good
      studies from which have been made by Messrs. Watts and Child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two small views on the Grand Canal at Venice, by Gwardi, have
      employed the talents of Miss Dujardin, Mr. E. Child, Mr.
      Watts, and Master Pasmore. But it is impossible to enumerate,
      in this hasty notice, all the arduous undertakings of the
      students: suffice it to say, that they have gained another
      step towards pictorial fame, and that their copies, from the
      works of Rubens, Wouvermans, Murillo, Canaletti, Titian,
      &amp;c., are honourable testimonies of their exertion to
      excel.

    <h3>
      A TOUR IN THE ISLAND OF JERSEY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>Concluded from page 262</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A view of the western side of Jersey, is calculated to
      impress a stranger with an idea that it is a barren,
      unproductive island; but no supposition could be more
      erroneous, as, in fact, a great proportion of it may be
      described as orchard. The extent of ground planted, with
      fruit trees&mdash;apple, pear, and plumb is prodigious; and
      consequently cider&mdash;and very excellent cider
      too&mdash;is one of the staple products of the country, and a
      favourite beverage among the natives. At the Union Hotel, St.
      Helier, boarders were allowed to quaff as much as they had a
      liking for, without being subjected to any additional charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      About three miles inland from St. Helier, is a singular
      structure named Prince's Tower, erected on an artificial
      mound or tumulus, and embowered in a grove of fine trees. The
      extensive prospect it commanded, and the indubitable
      antiquity of the masonry, induced me to apply for permission
      to ascend it; and I was rewarded with a bird's eye view of
      nearly the whole island, and a vast sweep of the French coast
      extending almost from Cape de la Hogue to Avranches. An
      Englishman had lately taken up his abode in the tower, which,
      with the adjacent pleasure ground, he rented at forty pounds
      a-year. His object was to render it a place of resort to the
      inhabitants of St. Helier, and his advertisements promised
      that the "delightful emotions excited by its unrivalled
      scenery, and the harmonious chat of the feathered tribe,
      should not be counteracted by the comfortless sensations of
      hunger, thirst, and weariness." The interior of the tower was
      neatly and appropriately fitted up. One apartment was
      designated the chapel; and in the highest room were several
      telescopes, mounted so as to traverse to any point of the
      compass, for the gratification of visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is the traditionary history of Prince's Tower that
      renders it interesting in the eyes of the islanders. In
      former times it was known by the name of La Hogue-Bye, and
      the following legend, quoted from <i>Le Livre noir de
      Coutances</i>, gives the origin of its celebrity:&mdash;In
      remote times, a moor or fen in this part of Jersey, was the
      retreat of a monstrous serpent or dragon, which spread terror
      and devastation throughout the island. At length a valorous
      Norman, the Seigneur de Hambye, undertook to attempt its
      destruction, which, after a terrible conflict, he
      accomplished. He was accompanied in this adventure by a
      vassal of whose fidelity he had no suspicion, but who, seeing
      his lord overcome by fatigue, after having vanquished the
      reptile, suddenly bethought himself of monopolizing the glory
      of the action. Instigated by this foul ambition, he
      assassinated his lord, and, returning to Normandy,
      promulgated a fictitious narrative of the encounter; and, to
      further his iniquitous views, presented a forged letter,
      which he said had been written by De Hambye to his widow,
      just before his death, enjoining her to reward his faithful
      servant, by accepting him as her second husband. Reverence
      for the last injunction of her deceased lord, induced the
      lady to obey, and she was united to his murderer. But the
      exultation of the homicidal slave was of short duration. His
      sleep was disturbed by horrid dreams; and at length, in one
      of his nightly paroxysms, he disclosed the extent of his
      villany. On being arrested and questioned, he made a full
      confession, and was tried, found guilty, and
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page279" name="page279"></a>[pg
      279]</span> publicly executed. De Hambye's widow, in memory
      of her lord, caused a tumulus of earth, to be raised on the
      spot where he was buried; and on the summit she built a
      chapel, with a tower so lofty, as to be visible from her own
      mansion at Coutances.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for the fable. As to the word <i>Hogue</i>, there are
      several places in Jersey called <i>Hougues</i>, which are
      always situated on a rising ground. The word has evidently
      originated from the German <i>hoch</i>, from which is derived
      our English <i>high</i>. A <i>hougue</i>, therefore, means a
      mound or hillock, and in the present instance, the addition
      of <i>bye</i> is obviously a contraction of Hambye; and, in
      accordance with the foregoing tradition, means literally the
      <i>barrow</i> or tomb of the <i>Seigneur de Hambye</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chapel at la Hogue is said to have been rebuilt in
      imitation of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem, by one of the
      popish deans of Jersey, in the reign of Henry VIII. La
      Hogue-bye remained for many years in a dilapidated state,
      till about 1790, when the late Admiral d'Auvergne, a native
      of Jersey, better known under his French title of Duke of
      Bouillon, became its owner by purchase, and hence it obtained
      its present name. At his death, in 1816, it was purchased by
      the late lieutenant-governor, Lieutenant-General Sir Hugh
      Mackay Gordon, whose heirs afterwards sold it to Francis le
      Breton, Esq., to whom it now belongs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most prominent object in the noble panoramic view from
      the top of Prince's Tower, is a huge fortress on the eastern
      side of the island, called the Castle of Mont Orgueil. It
      crests a lofty conical rock, that forms the northern headland
      of Grouville Bay, and looks down, like a grim giant, on the
      subjacent strait. The fortifications encircle the cone in
      picturesque tiers, and the apex of the mountain shoots up in
      the centre of them, as high as the flag-staff, which is in
      fact planted upon it. During war a strong garrison constantly
      occupied Mont Orgueil, but now a corporal and two privates of
      artillery composed the whole military force. The corporal, a
      quiet intelligent man, who spoke with much horror of paying a
      visit to the West Indies, which, in the mutations of his
      professional life, he had a prospect of doing at no distant
      period, acted as <i>cicerone</i>, and, among other places,
      introduced me into a small circular apartment, forming one of
      the suite appropriated to officers, which he said had been
      the habitation of Charles II. when a wanderer. This prince,
      when his unfortunate father fell into the hands of the
      regicidal party, found a loyal welcome in Jersey. Here he was
      recognised as king, when in England they sought his blood:
      here he remained in security, when his fatherland afforded
      him no asylum. During his lonely sojourn in this remote
      portion of his hereditary dominions, he is said to have
      employed himself in making a survey and delineating a map of
      the island. The natives, flattered by the confidence he
      reposed in them, and justly proud of nine centuries of
      unblemished loyalty to the throne of Great Britain, still
      refer to his residence as a memorable event; and in no other
      part of the British dominions, is the memory of the "merry
      monarch" more respected. When Cromwell, after the disastrous
      issue of the battle of Worcester, sent an expedition, under
      Admiral Blake, to reduce the island, it made a most gallant
      and protracted defence; and had not circumstances conspired
      to favour the Invaders, their victory would have been dearly
      purchased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mount Orgueil, in point of historical association, is by far
      the most interesting spot in Jersey. A part of the
      fortifications, according to tradition, are coeval with
      Caesar's incursions into Gaul; and the islanders hold it
      famous in their oldest story, and of antiquity beyond record.
      In 1374, the celebrated Constable du Guesclin passed over
      from Bretagne at the head of a large army, including some of
      the bravest knights of France, and encamped before this
      fortress, then called Gouray Castle, into which the principal
      inhabitants had retired for safety; but after a siege of
      several months, he was obliged to draw off his forces in
      despair, and quit the island. Henry V. added much to the
      strength and beauty of Gouray&mdash;made it a depot of arms,
      and conferred on it the proud name of Mont Orgueil. About
      1461, Nanfant, the governor, a dependent of Henry VI. was
      prevailed upon, by an order of Queen Margaret, to surrender
      it to Surdeval, a Frenchman, agent of Peter de Brez&eacute;,
      Count of Maulevrier; but though de Brez&eacute; kept
      possession of it for several years, the natives, under the
      command of Philip de Carteret, Seigneur of St. Ouen, a family
      long illustrious in Jersey annals, prevented him from
      completely subjugating the island. Sir Richard Harliston,
      vice-admiral of England, afterwards re-captured Mont Orgueil,
      and put an end to Maulevrier's usurpation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small pier, intended to facilitate the landing of stores,
      and shelter the numerous
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page280" name="page280"></a>[pg
      280]</span> oyster vessels that resort to Grouville Bay at
      the dredging season, projects into the sea, immediately under
      the castle guns. The bay, like that of St. Aubin, is defended
      by a regular line of martello towers, several of which are
      built far within flood-mark, on reefs that form part of the
      Violet Bank. The adjacent country is a perfect garden, and
      numerous secluded villas and cottages are scattered among the
      umbrageous and productive orchards that spread around. A
      small village, called Goree, lies a short way southward of
      Mont Orgueil. In former times, it was a sutling-place for the
      garrison; now it is only the rendezvous of a few
      oyster-fishers. In the auberges here, (every alternate house
      retailed liquor), brandy sold at a shilling a bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road leading directly from Grouville to St. Helier runs
      parallel with the southern shore, among corn fields,
      orchards, and hamlets, and is the best in the island. I
      travelled it after sunset, and found myriads of toads hopping
      across it in every direction. These reptiles are extremely
      common in Jersey; while, in the neighbouring island of
      Guernsey, if popular report may be credited, they are not
      only unknown, but cannot exist, as has been ascertained by
      importing them from less favoured countries. This exemption
      in favour of Guernsey, is in all probability a mere fable,
      originating with some ignorant native, the absurdity of which
      no person has been at the trouble to expose. Lizards and
      small snakes are also numerous in Jersey; and at night-fall,
      a chorus of crickets resounds from every hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jersey cattle are small; but like the pigmy breed of the
      Scottish Highlands, their flesh is delicate, and their milk
      and butter rich. The butcher market at St. Helier is supplied
      chiefly from France. There are sportsmen in Jersey as well as
      in other countries, but game is neither various nor abundant.
      The list, however, includes hares, rabbits, the Jersey
      partridge, a beautiful bird, with pheasant eyes, red legs,
      and variegated plumage; and several varieties of water fowl.

      The Romans, the pioneers of discovery and civilization in
      Europe, conferred on Jersey the name of Caesarea, in honour
      of their leader; and Caesar and Tacitus concur in describing
      it as a stronghold of Druidism, of which worship many
      monuments still exist. The aborigines were doubtless sprung
      from the Celtic tribes spread over the adjacent continent;
      but the present inhabitants are universally recognised as the
      lineal descendants of the warlike Normans, who, under the
      auspices of the famous Rollo, conquered and established
      themselves in the north of France in the ninth century. It
      was first attached to the British crown at the conquest; and
      though repeated descents have been made on it by France
      during the many wars waged between the countries since that
      remote era, none of them were attended with such success as
      to lead to a permanent occupation of the island. The
      islanders, proud of an unconquered name, and gratified to
      recollect that they originally gave a king to England, not
      England a king to them, have been always distinguished for
      fidelity to the British government; and their unshaken
      loyalty has, from time to time, been rewarded by immunities
      and privileges, highly conducive to their prosperity, and
      calculated to foster that spirit of nationality, which is
      invariably distinctive of a free people. They are exempted
      from those taxes which press heaviest on the English yeoman,
      and from naval and military service beyond the boundaries of
      their own island. The local administration of justice is
      still regulated by the old Norman code of laws, and this
      circumstance is regarded by the natives as a virtual
      recognition of their independence; but strangers, when they
      inadvertently get involved in legal disputes, have often
      cause to regret its existence. In cases of assault,
      particularly the assaulting of a magistrate, even though his
      official character be unknown to the offender, a severe
      punishment is generally awarded. We heard several instances
      of military officers, who had been guilty of raising an arm
      of flesh against jurats in night frolics at St. Helier's,
      narrowly escaping the penalty attached to this heinous
      infraction of the laws&mdash;a penalty which would have left
      them maimed for life.

      The introduction of Christianity, and final extirpation of
      idolatry, is said to have occurred in the sixth century. In
      the latter days of the reign of popery, Jersey formed part of
      the diocese of Coutances in Normandy, where the ancient
      records of the island were deposited; but at the Reformation,
      in the reign of Elizabeth, it was attached to the see of
      Winchester&mdash;an annexation, however, merely nominal, for
      the island is in reality exempt from the dominion of the
      church of England. The inhabitants are a well-disposed and
      peaceable race, but not particularly distinguished
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name="page281"></a>[pg
      281]</span> for enthusiasm in religion. The peasantry are
      orderly and industrious; the merchants enterprising; and the
      seamen, a numerous class, hardy and adventurous. The
      <i>aggregate</i> of the people live more after the French
      manner than the English; that is, they substitute fruit and
      vegetables, in a great measure, for animal food, and cider
      for ale. Neither men nor women are distinguished for personal
      beauty, though we noticed several very comely dames in our
      perambulations; and notwithstanding the boasted purity of
      their descent from the ocean-roamers of the north, they have
      many of the anomalous features of a mixed
      race.&mdash;<i>Edinburgh Journal of Natural and Geographical

      THE MOLE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Foreign naturalists have been much occupied of late with the
      mole. From the recently published observations of one of
      them, M. Flourens, it appears that this animal, as its
      organization indicates, is, if not exclusively, at least,
      essentially, carnivorous. It very soon dies if only roots be
      given to it; and if it destroy so many roots of vegetables,
      it is not for the purpose of eating them, but to seek among
      them for worms, insects, and particularly for the larvae of
      insects which harbour there. They may be kept alive for a
      long time upon any animal food. Ten or twelve hours are
      nearly the longest time they can live without food. Like all
      animals which feed upon blood and flesh, the mole is always
      very thirsty.&mdash;<i>Monthly Mag</i>.

      CLIMATE OF THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The climate of the British dominions in the south of Africa
      is one of the finest in the world. The average height of the
      barometer is above thirty inches, and the average summer heat
      at noon is about 78 deg. It resembles the climate of Italy,
      but is rather warmer and dryer. It is so dry, that draining
      is little required for the ground: on the contrary, it is
      necessary to retain moisture as much as possible, and even
      irrigation is desirable, more especially from the grasses.
      The mountains abound in springs, but the supply of water is
      scanty and precarious, from the want of energy and skill in
      procuring that essential article. Such a scarcity frequently
      arises, that the cattle perish from thirst, and the people
      themselves are in danger of a similar fate.&mdash;<i>Gill's

      beautiful silvery white, elegantly straited on each of the
      feather-like processes, with lines or streaks of the deepest
      black. It is extremely rare, and is a native of the Indian

      THE RED SEA-PEN IS
    </h3>
    <p>
      Of a very beautiful appearance, and is found on the British
      coast. The animal consists of a flattened stem, or body,
      which is furnished with an internal bone, and dilates into an
      expanded part, consisting of several pinnae, or lateral
      branches, which are divided on their inner edges into a
      number of tubular processes, through each of which is
      protruded a part of the animal, resembling the head of a
      hydra or polype; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page282"
      name="page282"></a>[pg 282]</span> the whole animal may,
      therefore, be considered as a very compound or ramified union
      of polypi, the bodies of which are contained in the naked
      part or stem, and from thence ramify into a vast number of
      processes, each furnished with its particular head. The
      animal emits a very strong phosphoric light, and it is even
      so luminous, that it is no uncommon circumstance for the
      fishermen to see the fish which happen to be swimming near it
      merely by the light of the Pens. Its colour is a bright red
      crimson, and the general size that of the figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ellis, in the Philosophical Transactions, has published
      some specimens of this extraordinary animal, of a
      kidney-shaped form, and observes that it nourishes and
      supports itself by the succours of polype filaments, which we
      have expressed in the Engraving in a magnified size. By these
      they take in their food and discharge the exuviae. In case of
      danger these little succours are drawn in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sea Pens are termed <i>locomotive zoophytes,</i> and swim in
      the manner of fish. Five hundred polypes may frequently be
      numbered on a single feather; and they number among the most
      rare and interesting animals of the order to which they
      belong.

    <p>
      Steam has been lately found very successful in cleansing
      ships from vermin, and especially the white ant. In India, a
      steam boat was lately placed alongside a merchant vessel, and
      steam from its boiler conveyed by a very simple system of
      pipes in the hold of the latter, the apertures to which were
      closed as well as they could be. The operation was continued
      for several hours; and there is reason to believe it was
      effectual, and will prove a valuable process in the navy.
      Besides the direct object of cleansing the ship, another
      advantage accrued from the discovery of every leaky place
      existing, by the oozing of the water through it. The expense
      is said to be very moderate; and it is further stated to be
      the only process at present known, not even except sinking,
      which effectually destroys the white ant.&mdash;<i>Brande's

      England possesses more pasture land than any other European

      In agriculture, France is a century behind England; and to

      which, since that time, has more than doubled the prosperity
      of the former country.
    </p>
    <p>
      England not only surpasses France in the number of its
      cattle, but the animals are also finer, and their flesh is of
      better quality; so that an Englishman may enjoy nearly double
      the quantity of animal food that France supplies to each of
      its inhabitants, and with the further advantage of better
      quality. "Oh, the Roast Beef of Old England."

      <i>Indian Rouge</i>.
    </center>
    <p>
      We find in <i>Jameson's</i> last <i>Journal</i>, a very
      interesting paper by Dr. Hancock, on a Red Pigment, called
      <i>Carucru</i>, or <i>Chica</i>, which appears to be the
      Rouge of the interior Indians. It is produced like Indigo,
      from the plant chiefly found towards the head of Essequibo,
      Parima, and Rio Negro. On breaking a branch, the leaves, when
      dry, become almost of a blood red, and being pounded, are
      infused in water till a fermentation ensues. The liquor is
      then poured off and left to deposit a settlement, which forms
      the <i>Chica</i> paint. It is put up very neatly in little
      caskets made with palm leaves, and carried by the Atorayas
      and trading Caribs all over Guiana. It has a soft, cochineal,
      crimson shade, and is in great demand among the Indians as an
      ornamental paint. The use is chiefly for the face, whilst
      they stain the other parts of the body with Arnotta. They
      also apply the Chica on the cheeks and about the eyes, and
      variegate the countenance by marking the forehead, and along
      the facial line, with their coomazu, a yellow clay or ochre.
      This manner of painting produces a striking contrast, and
      gives them a very strange and furious appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the scarcity of the Chica, its employment is almost
      exclusively confined to the chiefs and higher orders, their
      nobility. The rest must be contented with Arnotta, or Poncer
      mixed with the oil of Carapa, a portion of which, with the
      Balsam of Aracousiri, mixed with these paints, imparts to
      them a very delightful odour. The <i>toilet</i>, therefore,
      of the rude tribes is as simple as their manners and mode of
      life, their chief material being perfume, and all being
      carried in a little gourd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chica is not merely esteemed as a pigment, but is
      considered in the Orinoko as the most sovereign remedy for
      erysipelas, where that complaint is very prevalent. It is
      simply made with water into a paste, thinly spread on old
      linen <span class="pagenum"><a id="page283"

      The Tacumas (Indians) are the fabricators of those curious

      very hard wood, studded over with pointed flint stones, and
      fixed by a kind of cement and varnish of surprising
      durability; the substance being at the same time a strong
      cement and transparent varnish. These Cassada Graters are

          And the stare of his ghastly eye,

        <p>
          When he turned in hurried haste away,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          Yet he had no power to fly;
        </p>
        <p>
          He was chained to the deck with his heavy guilt,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          And the blood that was not dry.

      <div class="stanza">

          'Twas a cursed thing,' said I, 'to kill

          That old man in his sleep!

        <p>
          Still the captain's eye was fixed on me,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          But he answered never a word.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          And he slowly lifted his bloody hand

        <p class="i2">
          His aching eyes to shade,

        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          And he shrinked like one afraid.

          The wind dropped, and a spell

        <p class="i2">

        <p class="i2">
          Were dark, like molten lead.

        <p class="i2">
          Of the air so hot and dry.

        <p class="i2">

      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          The captain's son was on board with us,

        <p class="i2">
          A fair child, seven years old,

          With a merry look that all men loved,

      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          I loved the child, and I took his hand,

        <p class="i2">
          And made him kneel and pray
        </p>
        <p>
          That the crime; for which the calm was sent,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          Might be purged clean away.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          For I thought that God would hear his prayer,

        <p class="i2">
          And set the vessel free,&mdash;
        </p>
        <p>
          For a dreadful thing it was to lie

        <p class="i2">
          Upon that charnel sea.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          Yet I told him not wherefore he prayed,

        <p class="i2">
          Nor why the calm was sent
        </p>
        <p>
          I would not give that knowledge dark

        <p class="i2">
          To a soul so innocent.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          At length I saw a little cloud

        <p class="i2">
          Arise in that sky of flame,
        </p>
        <p>
          A little cloud&mdash;but it grew and grew,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          And blackened as it came.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          And we saw the sea beneath its track

        <p class="i2">
          Grow dark as the frowning sky,
        </p>
        <p>
          And water-spouts, with a rushing sound,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          Like giants, passed us by.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          And all around, 'twixt sky and sea,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          A hollow wind did blow;
        </p>
        <p>
          And the waves were heaved from the ocean depths,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          And the ship rocked to and fro.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          I knew it was that fierce death-calm
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          Its horrid hold undoing,
        </p>
        <p>
          And I saw the plagues of wind and storm
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          Their missioned work pursuing.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          There was a yell in the gathering winds,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          A groan in the heaving sea,
        </p>
        <p>
          And the captain rushed from the hold below,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          But he durst not look on me.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          He seized each rope with a madman's haste,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          And he set the helm to go,
        </p>
        <p>
          And every sail he crowded on
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          As the furious winds did blow.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          And away they went, like autumn leaves
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          Before the tempest's rout,
        </p>
        <p>
          And the naked masts with a crash came down,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          And the wild ship tossed about.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          The men, to spars and splintered boards,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          Clung, till their strength was gone,
        </p>
        <p>
          And I saw them from their feeble hold
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          Washed over one by one.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          And 'mid the creaking timber's din,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          And the roaring of the sea,
        </p>
        <p>
          I heard the dismal, drowning cries
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          Of their last agony.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          There was a curse in the wind that blew,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          A curse in the boiling wave;
        </p>
        <p>
          And the captain knew that vengeance came
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          From the old man's ocean grave.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          And I heard him say, as he sate apart,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          In a hollow voice and low,
        </p>
        <p>
          'Tis a cry of blood doth follow us,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          And still doth plague us so!'
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          And then those heavy iron chests
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          With desperate strength took he,
        </p>
        <p>
          And ten of the strongest mariners
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          Did cast them into the sea.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          And out, from the bottom of the sea,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          There came a hollow groan;&mdash;
        </p>
        <p>
          The captain by the gunwale stood,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          And he looked like icy stone&mdash;
        </p>
        <p>
          And he drew in his breath with a gasping sob,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          And a spasm of death came on.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          And a furious boiling wave rose up,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          With a rushing, thundering roar,&mdash;
        </p>
        <p>
          I saw the captain fall to the deck,
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          But I never saw him more.

          Two days before, when the storm began,

        <p class="i2">
          That meek child in his misery,

        <p>
          At length, as if his prayers were heard,

        <p class="i2">
          A steady wind from the west did blow,

          That fair young child and I,

          There was no bread within the wreck,

          Yet he murmured not, and cheered me

        <p class="i2">
          When my last hopes were gone;

        <p class="i2">

      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          Still on we drove,

          I knew not where,

          For many nights and days,

          Amid the great South Sea,

    <h3>
      THE LITTLE MAJOR'S LOVE ADVENTURE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      You must know, when I was in the 18th light dragoons, I was
      quartered in Canterbury; and having got some introductory
      letters, I contrived to make out a pleasant time enough. One
      of my visiting-houses was old Tronson's the
      banker's&mdash;devilish agreeable family&mdash;four pretty
      girls&mdash;all flirted&mdash;painted on velvet&mdash;played
      the harp&mdash;sang Italian, and danced as if they had been
      brought up under D'Egville in the <i>corps de ballet.</i> The
      old boy kept a man-cook, and gave iced champagne. Now, you
      know, there is no standing this; and Harriette, the second of
      the beauties, and I, agreed to fall in love, which in due
      course of time we effected. Nothing could be better managed
      than the whole affair; we each selected a confidant, sat for
      our pictures, interchanged them with a passionate note, and
      made a regular engagement for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the state of things, when the route came, and my
      troop was ordered to embark for Portugal. Heavens! what a
      commotion! Harriette was in hysterics: we talked of an
      elopement, and discussed the propriety of going to Gretna;
      but the hurry to embark prevented us. I could not, you know,
      take her with me. Woman in a transport! a devilish bore; and
      nothing was left for it but to exchange vows of eternal
      fidelity. We did so, and parted&mdash;both persuaded that our
      hearts were reciprocally broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah!&mdash;if you knew what I suffered night and day! her
      picture rested in my bosom; and I consumed a pipe of wine in
      toasting her health, while I was dying of damp and
      rheumatism. But the recollection of my <i>constant
      Harriette</i> supported me through all; and particularly so,
      when I was cheered by the report of my snub-nosed surgeon,
      who joined us six months after at Santarem, and assured me on
      the faith of a physician, that the dear girl was in the last
      stage of a consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years passed away, and we were ordered home. O heavens!
      what were my feelings when I landed at Portsmouth! I threw
      myself into a carriage, and started with four horses for
      Canterbury: I arrived there with a safe neck, and lost not a
      moment in announcing my return to my constant Harriette.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delay of the messenger seemed an eternity: but what were
      my feelings, when he brought me a perfumed note (to do her
      justice, she always wrote on lovely letter-paper), and a
      parcel. The one contained congratulations of my safe arrival,
      accompanied by assurances of unfeigned regret that I had not
      reached Canterbury a day sooner, and thus allowed her an
      opportunity of having her "dear friend Captain Melcomb"
      present at her wedding; while the packet was a large
      assortment of French kid skins and white ribbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      That blessed morning she had bestowed her fair hand on a fat
      professor of theology from Brazen Nose, who had been just
      presented to a rich prebend by the bishop, for having proved
      beyond a controversy, the divine origin of tithes, in a
      blue-bound pamphlet. Before I had time to recover from my
      astonishment, a travelling carriage brought me to the window;
      and quickly as it passed, I had full time to see <i>ma belle
      Harriette</i> seated beside the thick-winded dignitary. She
      bowed her white Spanish hat and six ostrich feathers to me as
      she rolled off, to spend, as the papers informed me, "the
      honey-moon at the lakes of Cumberland.' There was a blessed
      return for two years' exposure to the attacks of rheumatism
      and French cavalry.&mdash;<i>Stories of Waterloo.</i>

      When the celebrated Philip Henry was ejected from the
      establishment, Dr. Busby (who had been his tutor) meeting
      him, said, "Who made you a nonconformist?" "You, Sir,"
      replied he, "I made you a nonconformist!" "Yes, Sir, you
      taught me those principles which forbade to violate my
      conscience."

    <h3>
      ANTWERP CATHEDRAL.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Antwerp possesses considerable interest to an Englishman, as
      a place of great importance during the late war, when there
      was a sort of mystery attached to it, as the secret grand
      naval depot of Napoleon, which our Government thought to
      "cripple France for ever," by getting into our own hands! But
      what the Earl of Chatham, with an army of twenty thousand
      men, aided by a fine British fleet, could not do, I did: I
      made my entry into Antwerp&mdash;without molestation, thanks
      to the benign Spirit of Peace&mdash;towards the evening of a
      fine day in July; and while the impression of novelty was
      still fresh, enjoyed a rich treat in viewing its noble
      Cathedral. The interior is grand, but simple&mdash;striking
      the beholder more by its loftiness and spaciousness, than by
      any profusion of glittering ornament, so common in Catholic
      churches&mdash;although the forest of pillars, the
      altar-piece, the statues, and above all the splendid pictures
      which grace the walls, form a rich variety to the eye. It
      would be useless to enter into a minute detail, for no
      description can give a stranger a perfect idea of one
      building distinct from others of a similar kind, and those
      who have seen the object itself do not require it. Antwerp
      may be called the country of Rubens: at every turn you meet
      with monuments of his genius; and here (in the Cathedral) you
      have what is esteemed his masterpiece&mdash;the "Descent from
      the Cross"&mdash;which surprises you with a boldness of
      drawing, vigour and richness of colouring, and an animation
      in the grouping, that can scarcely be excelled; and when you
      discern the colossal figures from a little distance amongst
      the pillars and arches of the nave, you feel inclined to bow
      in reverence to the divinity of the genius which has
      portrayed so wonderful a conception of the mind. It is
      needless to say that this was one of the works of art carried
      to Paris to enrich the gallery of the Louvre, together with
      one placed in a corresponding situation, "The Assumption of
      the Virgin," which is more in Rubens' florid style than the
      former. There is also, by the same master-hand, a noble
      picture, "The Elevation of the Cross," in the artist's
      happiest manner; and the exquisite altarpiece, "The
      Ascension," is also his work. There are several other fine
      paintings here&mdash;one of them said to be the best
      performance of Quintin Matsys, who, under the inspiration of
      love, deserted the anvil for the pallet; and another by his
      father-in-law, Flors, supposed to be the identical picture
      upon which the <i>ci devant</i> blacksmith painted a bee,
      with such skill as to obtain the old artist's cordial consent
      to the marriage of Matsys with his daughter. Amongst the
      carved wood-work in the aisles, we admired the execution of
      several statues of Saints, male and female, whose features
      and drapery are finished with all the delicacy of marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shades of evening now began to add to the solemnity of
      the scene, by the indistinctness that was gradually
      enveloping the more distant objects; and, alone, we almost
      dreaded to break, with our own whispers, the silence which
      reigned around. In the midst of this "stillness audible," the
      fine bell of the cathedral struck the hour, and its melodious
      tone seemed at once to reach the heart. We sat down to listen
      to the prolonged note, as each successive toll reverberated
      through the expanse&mdash;lingering like a halo around the
      walls, and appearing to awaken echoes from the guardian
      spirits of the night. I fancied I had never in my life heard
      so full-toned&mdash;so musical a bell: certain it is, none
      ever gave me the same sensation of delight. Indeed, the whole
      belfry is well assorted, for the <i>carillons</i>, which play
      certain airs at intervals, produce a sweeter effect than I
      remember any where else; and one of the pleasant
      recollections I retain of Antwerp arises out of the frequent,
      but unobtrusive, chimes that salute the ear during the day.
      We left Notre Dame this time with "lingering steps and slow."
    </p>
    <p>
      But how can I give an idea of the exterior? The tendency to
      placid reflection which we had caught within found ample food
      for indulgence when we came to witness the effect of the
      architecture without, combined with the particular time of
      night&mdash;about nine o'clock&mdash;different tints and
      shadows displaying themselves upon the angles of the
      building, as the light decreased. Imagine a spire of light,
      ornamental, elegant open-work, carried up about a hundred
      feet higher than St. Paul's. I believe it is the loftiest in
      Europe, with the exception of Strasbourg, than which, in the
      opinion of many, it is more handsome. The only drawback upon
      its beauty is the glaringly large dial of the clock; but even
      this may suggest appropriate reflection: for may we not
      consider it an emblem of Time, whose course it measures,
      intruding upon the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page287"
      name="page287"></a>[pg 287]</span> fairest prospects of our
      lives, to remind us that all human monuments and enjoyments
      must yield to his irresistible hand? The spire rises on one
      side of the principal entrance; and there is a corresponding
      tower on the other, to the height of the base of the steeple
      part, as if there had been an intention to erect one of
      similar dimensions there also, like the twin towers of
      Westminster Abbey; but I cannot help thinking, that as two
      and two are said not always to make four, the projecting
      counterpart, instead of doubling the effect, would have
      lessened the feeling of stupendous height with which the
      present single pinnacle inspires the beholders. As there
      cannot be two suns in the same sphere, neither could the
      spire of Antwerp have borne a rival near its solitary, aerial
      throne. It soars aloft with such grandeur, that in gazing
      upon it my brain actually grew dizzy with the sight: never
      was I conscious in an equal degree of such a feeling of awe
      from a work of art, and my mind really ached with the
      intensity of the impression.&mdash;We seemed to view this
      sublime object with mutual wonder and admiration&mdash;gazing
      upon it in one position, then in another&mdash;walking
      about&mdash;stopping&mdash;excited as it were by the same
      impulse. Once, when nearly dark, as our eyes were fixed upon
      the top, a gentle light suddenly appeared upon the very
      summit, crowning the majestic fane with glory, as if pointing
      it out for admiration to a surrounding world: it was a star
      twinkling upon the very spot where the highest point of the
      spire rested on the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of Antwerp is derived from <i>Hand-werpen</i> or
      <i>Hand-thrown</i>: so called from a legend, which informs us
      that on the site of the present city once stood the castle of
      a giant, who held the neighbouring country in thraldom, and
      who was accustomed to amuse himself by cutting off, and
      casting into the river, the right hands of the unfortunate
      wights that fell into his power; but that being at last
      conquered himself, his own immense hand was disposed of, with
      poetical justice, in the same way. With the impression of
      this story on my mind, it came into my head that the giant
      was personified by the towering spire: no wonder, thought I,
      that Don Quixote mistook a windmill for a giant, since I,
      even in my sober senses, cannot get rid of the idea that I
      see the mighty hand-thrower before me. With a little
      confusion of the image, I then imagined the spire to be the
      guardian of the city&mdash;that it took cognizance of all its
      affairs, and that it would watch me even into my retreat for
      the night. Like the adored phantom of youthful love, it
      pervaded every place, and haunted me in my dreams. Often the
      motion of the clouds seemed to be transferred to the lofty
      spire, which again assuming the giant character startled me
      with the impression that it was falling towards me, or
      rushing to crush its victims, like the horrid car of
      Jaggernaut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the Giant's Gate, so called from a colossal statue
      reclining upon it, there is an opening to the
      Scheldt;&mdash;without is the quay, covered with merchandize
      unloading from the ships in the river, and serving as an
      evening promenade. Here you may see the other eminences of
      the city occasionally, but the gigantic one&mdash;always: it
      stalks out from amidst the cluster of buildings your constant
      companion wherever you go&mdash;as you walk along, it appears
      to move with you, and when you stop it waits with patience
      until you go on again. On another occasion we took a boat on
      the Scheldt, and landing at some distance below the town, had
      a delightful walk along its banks, which are elevated like
      part of Milbank, near Vauxhall-bridge; and the situation has
      much the same character. The river, however, is grander, as I
      should judge it to be twice the width of the Thames at
      London-bridge, and it flows with great rapidity. It was a
      charming evening, and we saw the sun set in all his glory
      down the Scheldt, in the bosom of which were reflected the
      endless tints of the sky, whose golden brilliancy was
      beautifully relieved by the intervention of some cottages
      near us, and a pretty village, with its church-spire a little
      further off. On one side was the flat cultivated country of
      Flanders, and looking up the river, we beheld the shipping
      and the whole city: all the churches and towers raised their
      varied forms, but still only to do homage, as it were, to the
      great pile which outstripped them, and which was lit up by
      the radiance of the departed sun. Model of splendour! "from
      morn 'till dewy eve" how must thy elegant form be engraven on
      the hearts of the natives of the city thou overlookest,
      exciting emotions of home, like the craggy rock of the
      Highlanders, when they are absent in distant lands! and how
      must the youth, whom the love of art carries to study the
      treasures of Venice and Rome, when returning to shed a lustre
      upon his natal place&mdash;of being one day named with Matsys
      and Rubens, and the other splendid painters by whom it has
      been adorned&mdash;how <span class="pagenum"><a id="page288"
      name="page288"></a>[pg 288]</span> must the first glance that
      he catches of thy hallowed height make his heart throb with
      endearing thoughts of the friends he left under thy shade,
      and absorb for the moment all feelings of ambition in the
      recollection of the boyish days passed within thy
      ken&mdash;but now, alas, departed for ever! May the fires of
      heaven, and the tremblings of earth, never injure thy
      venerable beauty; but may thousands, and tens of thousands,
      in time to come, as in time past, gaze upon thee&mdash;as I,
      an obscure, nameless stranger, have done&mdash;with thoughts
      too deep for words!
    </p>
    <p>
      During the evening I have alluded to we were accompanied by
      the accomplished Miss &mdash;&mdash;, whose talents must be
      well known to many of our own artists who have visited
      Antwerp; and this being her native place, her conversation
      gave us those kindly associations of home, without which no
      scenes, however beautiful or however uncommon, can penetrate
      the inmost recesses of the soul.

      Our Correspondent, in a few introductory lines, modestly,
      though somewhat unnecessarily, apologizes for the enthusiasm
      of the reflective portion of the previous sketch. He will
      perceive that we have ventured upon a few slight alterations.
      He concludes his note to us with an assurance that "the
      feelings were sincere, however trifling the thoughts, or
      inadequate the expression." Of his sincerity we have no
      doubt; and where the feelings of a writer are so honourable
      to his heart as are many in this paper, we are not fastidious
      enough to quarrel with inadvertencies of the head. All have
      felt the overpowering effect produced by the contemplation of
      the sublimities of art, but comparatively few are aware of
      the difficulty of embodying these first impressions in
      descriptive detail.&mdash;ED.

      Vivian Grey pronounces school ushers execrable wretches,
      because they wear pepper and salt pantaloons; Lady Morgan
      improves upon him, declaring the man who wears a white
      waistcoat in the morning, or the woman who curtsies at a
      drawing-room door, out of the pale of society. It is
      surprising that people will write such rubbish as
      this&mdash;more surprising that others will print it&mdash;
      most surprising that folks buy it&mdash;and as Cobbett would
      say, what surprises us "most of all," is that people read it.

    <h3>
      ORIGIN OF THE WORD FARM.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Spelman derives this word from the Saxon term <i>fearme</i>,
      or <i>feorme</i>, which signifies <i>victus</i>, food, or
      <i>provision</i>, as the tenants and country people anciently
      paid their rents in victuals and other necessaries of life,
      but which was afterwards converted into the payment of
      certain sums of money. Hence a <i>ferm</i> was originally a
      place which furnished or supplied its owner or lord with
      provisions.

      At an inn in a market town upon the road to Holyhead, a
      gentleman sat in the kitchen smoking his pipe, and watching
      with anxiety a fowl that was roasting for his supper. At
      length a tall, meagre figure stalked in, and after an earnest
      and melancholy look at the fowl, retired with a sigh.
      Repeating his visit he exclaimed, "That fowl will never be
      done in time." "What do you mean?" said the gentleman, "that
      fowl is for my supper, and you shan't touch a bit of it."
      "Oh," replied the other, "you misunderstand me; I don't want
      the fowl; but I am to play <i>Oroonoko</i> this evening, and
      we cannot begin for want of the <i>jack chain</i>."

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
